# Data fetching issue causing blinking
In the My-Products, All-Products and History page where I have a loader alongside my product cards, there is some refetching which causes the component to blink slightly.
Does not occur if data is present, only occurs due to no data found. Possible to fix by debugging the issue regarding why refetching is occuring on empty data retrieve.
